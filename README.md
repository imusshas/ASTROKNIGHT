# ASTROKNIGHT

Our team **Nebula Nexus** is excited to introduce you to **"ASTROKNIGHT,"** a kids' game designed to inspire
children on their journey of becoming astronauts. This
game aims to educate and motivate kids by providing
valuable insights into various aspects of becoming an
astronaut, including their dietary habits, mental growth,
physical fitness, and knowledge about space.

In today's technology-driven world, it's hard to imagine a
day without screens and devices. Children spend hours
on smartphones, addicted to games and social media,
which can hinder their mental development. With
**"ASTROKNIGHT,"** we aim to create a fun and educational
experience, allowing children to learn by gameplay.

Since our childhood, we have been endlessly fascinated
by the vast expanse of space, the celestial sky, and the
mysteries of the galaxy. Our hidden desire to become
astronauts has driven us to create this game.
Astronauts are the embodiment of our dreams,
exploring the cosmos and pushing the boundaries of
human knowledge and adventure. With **"ASTROKNIGHT,"**
we hope to inspire the next generation of space
explorers and make learning about space a thrilling and
educational experience.

## Let's dive into the game
In the section below some demo levels of the game are provided.

### Level 1: Physical Fitness
At this level, children learn about the physical
requirements for astronauts. They are presented with
images illustrating ideal and bad astronaut attributes,
including age, vision, Body Mass Index, and blood
pressure. Meet Neil, our astronaut, and compare his age,
BMI, vision, and blood pressure to the ideal standards. Is
it a match? Yes or No?

In the second stage of this level, children assess their
lung capacity by attempting to hold their breath for 15
seconds. This activity is not meant to be serious but
rather to inspire children to focus on their lung health
and fitness.

### Level 2: Suit Up
Named "Suit Up," this level introduces children to the
components of a space suit. Their task is to assemble
the suit correctly by placing the helmet, lower torso,
upper hand torso, and life support torso in the right
order.

### Level 3: Survive
This level offers an exciting challenge in the form of a
maze. It is implemented with the feature play and learn.
Children must navigate the maze and select the
appropriate food items for an astronaut.

### Level 4: Solar System
At this level, children learn about the solar system. They
must carefully observe the orientation of the planets and
place them in their correct positions. Additionally, they'll
identify the largest and smallest planets in the solar
system.

## Conclusion

Likewise the demos given here, **ASTROKNIGHT** is
implemented with features like first learn and then play
as well as learn with play. **ASTROKNIGHT** believes that
if interest in astronomy can be created from childhood
then more involvement is possible which is highly
needed. **ASTROKNIGHT** covers todayâ€™s most demanding
teaching skill which is interactive learning.
