# ASTROKNIGHT

**ASTROKNIGHT** is a vision for the kids as a game designed to inspire children on their journey of becoming astronauts. This game aims to educate and motivate kids by providing valuable insights into various aspects of becoming an astronaut, including their dietary habits, mental growth, physical fitness, and knowledge about space.

In today's technology-driven world, it's hard to imagine a day without devices. Children spend hours on smartphones, by getting addicted to games and social media, which can hinder their mental development. With **"ASTROKNIGHT"**, we aim to create a fun and educational experience, allowing children to learn by gameplay.

Since our childhood, we have been endlessly fascinated by the vast expanse of space, the celestial sky, and the mysteries of the galaxy. Our hidden desire to become astronauts has driven us to create this game. Astronauts are the embodiment of our dreams, exploring the cosmos and pushing the boundaries of
human knowledge and adventure. With **"ASTROKNIGHT”**, we hope to inspire the next generation of space explorers and make learning about space a thrilling and educational experience.

## Let's dive into the game
Some demo levels of this game are provided here in the section below.

### Level 1: Physical Fitness
At this level, children learn about the physical requirements for astronauts. They are presented with images illustrating ideal and bad astronaut attributes, including age, vision, Body Mass Index, and blood pressure. Meet Neil, our astronaut, and compare his age, BMI, vision, and blood pressure to the ideal standards. Is it a match? Yes or No?

In the second stage of this level, children assess their lung capacity by attempting to hold their breath for 15 seconds. This activity is not meant to be serious but rather to inspire children to focus on their respiratory system's fitness.

### Level 2: Suit Up
Named as "Suit Up," this level introduces children to the components of a space suit. Their task is to assemble the suit correctly by placing the helmet, lower torso, upper hand torso, and life support torso in the right order.

### Level 3: Survive
This level offers an exciting challenge in the form of a maze. It is implemented with the feature "play and learn". Children must navigate the maze and select the appropriate food items for an astronaut.

### Level 4: Solar System
At this level, children learn about the solar system. They must carefully observe the orientation of the planets and place them in their corresponding correct positions. Additionally,  they'll learn to identify the largest and smallest planets in the solar system.

##Conclusion

Likewise the demos given here, **ASTROKNIGHT** is implemented with features like "first learn and then play" as well as "learning by playing". **ASTROKNIGHT** believes that if interest in astronomy can be created from childhood then more involvement is possible which is highly needed and expected as well. ASTROKNIGHT covers today’s most demanding teaching skill which is interactive learning.
